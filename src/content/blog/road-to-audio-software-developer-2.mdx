title: "The Road To Becoming An Audio Software Developer #2: First steps in CLAP City"
---

_**Warning**: this post turned into quite the technical deep dive with a lot of debugging and C programming &mdash; which I really liked and will continue to do &mdash; with which I'm assuming that anyone reading it has enough existing knowledge about C, compiling and debugging to understand it (not calling myself an advanced C programmer here, I just happened to understand what I did so far)._

As discussed in [the previous post](/blog/road-to-audio-software-developer-1), the first goal I want to accomplish is building a basic CLAP plug-in, as simple as possible, as close as possible to the bones of the CLAP plug-in format. All official code related to CLAP plug-ins is hosted on [free-audio](https://github.com/free-audio)'s GitHub organization, including a repository called [clap-plugins](https://github.com/free-audio/clap-plugins.git) which hosts a bunch of demo/example CLAP plug-ins. Unfortunately, it's not as plug-and-play as it sounds, as the plug-ins in the repository (located in `plugins/plugs`) share a lot of generic code. Additionally, the example plug-ins are written in C++, whereas I would want to use something like Zig or Rust (as if developing audio plug-ins isn't challenging enough).

After some more research, I stumbled upon `src/plugin-template.c` in the [free-audio/clap](https://github.com/free-audio/clap.git) repository, a starter point for a CLAP plug-in written in C, which allows me to fully grasp the details of the requirements of a working CLAP plug-in. It would be easier to use frameworks such as [JUCE](https://juce.com) (C++) or [nih-plug](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/nih-plug) (Rust), but these solutions hide away a lot of implementation details that are crucial in becoming an expert audio software developer.

Deserving of a worthy mention is [Nakst's brief CLAP tutorial series](https://nakst.gitlab.io/tutorial/clap-part-1.html), although its content is at least 3 years old (looking at the Git history of the linked C++ source files). I don't think the CLAP API has drastically changed since then, but it's something to keep in mind.

### Step 1: Setting up files, tools and commands

_If you're just looking for the end result of this blog post, I've created [a repository](https://github.com/tphbrok/minimal-clap-plugin-c) which houses everything mentioned in this post, and nothing else._

Diving into the deep end by going with Zig or Rust from the get-go is a terrible idea. The CLAP header files are written in C with a possibility of using a C++ glue layer, but for now, using C keeps me grounded and close to the belly of the beast. I can use the aforementioned `plugin-template.c` as a reference, but I'm not going to start copying and pasting code, because I want to understand every part of what I'm building. The goal of this step is to compile something to a `.clap` file, which a CLAP host will happily accept and load, even if nothing is actually running or initialized.

Fortunately, the guys and gals of **free-audio** also provide me with [free-audio/clap-host](https://github.com/free-audio/clap-host.git), acting as a minimal CLAP host, and [free-audio/clap-info](https://github.com/free-audio/clap-info.git), a command-line tool to inspect and validate a CLAP plug-in. I'll use the latter during development, because it compiles _much_ faster in case I want to insert some debugging statements when validating my CLAP plug-ins.

Time to get to work! I've created a new folder `minimal-clap-plugin-c`, and in there I run

```sh
# Initialize the Git repository
git init

# Add clap and clap-info as Git submodules,
# so they can be kept up-to-date
git submodule add git@github.com:free-audio/clap.git libs/clap-info
git submodule add git@github.com:free-audio/clap-info.git tools/clap-info

# Initialize clap-info's submodules
cd tools/clap-info
git submodule init && git submodule update
```

Next, I created a basic Makefile to manage build and run commands. I've also included build commands to build `clap-info`, so I can make changes where needed to debug any errors in my CLAP plug-in.

```sh
build: src/plugin.c
	rm -rf build
	mkdir build
	gcc -Wall -shared -fPIC -o ./build/plugin src/plugin.c

build-clap-info:
	cd tools/clap-info && cmake -Bbuild && cmake --build build

run-clap-info: src/plugin.c
	make build-clap-info
	make build
	./tools/clap-info/build/clap-info ./build/plugin
```

Now, as soon as I create `src/plugin.c` and run `make run-clap-info`, it compiles my CLAP plug-in and `clap-info`, and runs `clap-info` to validate the compiled CLAP plug-in directly.

With an empty `plugin.c`, running `make run-clap-info` results in a classical

```sh
# ... bunch of make logs
make: *** [clap-info] Segmentation fault: 11
```

Great, we can start building the plug-in, despite the fact that this error is very hard to debug, because a segmentation fault basically means that the OS decided to kill the program, because it tried to access something it shouldn't have. And because it happens in a compiled program, we're not getting a stack trace.

### Step 2: A (shallow) deep dive into the Apple's Core Foundation

There's probably a cleaner way to find out what's wrong, but for now, inserting a simple logging statement at random places in `clap-info` tells me where the error happens. After moving around

```cpp
std::cout << "test" << std::endl;
```

for a bit, I found out that the program exits when running

```cpp
auto db = CFBundleGetDataPointerForName(bundle, CFSTR("clap_entry"));
```

which is Apple's way (which makes perfect sense since I'm rocking a MacBook Pro) of trying to load a symbol with a given name, which in this case is 'clap_entry', returning a data pointer to the symbol in the provided executable (see [the `CFBundleGetDataPointerForName` documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/1537120-cfbundlegetdatapointerforname)). Looks like I have to get my hands dirty on Core Foundation for a bit to figure out what's wrong.

Luckily this isn't a dead end yet, because it's trying to load a symbol from an empty source file!

If I add a basic (surely incorrect) exported symbol to `plugin.c`, like

```c
__attribute__((visibility("default"))) int clap_entry = 1;
```

and consecutively run

```sh
nm build/plugin
```

I get a summary of all exported symbols, which in case of `build/plugin` is

```
0000000000004000 D _clap_entry
```

Unfortunately, running `make run-clap-info` still crashes, with the same error when running the same line of code. If I log the result of the function call right before the crashing one, which is

```cpp
auto bundle = CFBundleCreate(kCFAllocatorDefault, bundleURL);
```

the result is `0x0`, which `CFBundleCreate` returns if it failed to load the bundle. This remembered me of the fact that MacOS wants to have executables packaged up nicely in a specific format and bundle, including metadata files like `Info.plist` and `PkgInfo`. Moreover, if I Google `Info.plist`, it shows me an XML file that has properties like `CFBundleExecutable` and `CFBundleName`. This might be what I was missing!

### Step 3: Building a nice Apple package

It's time to create a template output directory for the plugin executable to end up in, which `CFBundleCreate` will happily accept. I've created a folder in the root folder of the repository, which contains a bunch of folders, subfolders and metadata files, derived (but not copied!) from another open-source CLAP plug-in I found on GitHub. The highlights of the new output folder are where the executable will end up, which is `plugin.clap/Contents/MacOS/plugin` and the metadata in `Info.plist`, which is

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist>
  <dict>
    <key>CFBundleExecutable</key>
    <string>plugin</string>
    <key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>
    <string>me.tphbrok.plugin</string>
    <key>CFBundleName</key>
    <string>plugin</string>
    <key>CFBundleDisplayName</key>
    <string>plugin</string>
    <key>CFBundlePackageType</key>
    <string>BNDL</string>
    <key>CFBundleSignature</key>
    <string>????</string>
    <key>CFBundleShortVersionString</key>
    <string>1.0.0</string>
    <key>CFBundleVersion</key>
    <string>1.0.0</string>
  </dict>
</plist>
```

I do need to make some changes now in the Makefile, namely

```diff
build:
-   gcc -Wall -shared -fPIC -o ./build/plugin src/plugin.c
+   gcc -Wall -shared -fPIC -o ./plugin.clap/Contents/MacOS/plugin src/plugin.c

...

run-clap-info: src/plugin.c
	make build-clap-info
	make build
-	./tools/clap-info/build/clap-info ./build/plugin
+   ./tools/clap-info/build/clap-info ./plugin.clap

```

Now, running `make run-clap-info` again, `CFBundleCreate` returns `0x140e0b810` instead of `0x0`, meaning that the bundle is successfully loaded. Progress &mdash; time to get my debug logging statement out of my toolbox again.

I expected the next crashing statement to be

```cpp
auto version = entry->clap_version;
```

since it's trying to read `clap_version` from my dummy `clap_entry` value (an integer with value 1), but it results in "1.0.0" being outputted. Funnily enough, the `main.cpp` level parent function of the previously crashing statement typecasts `entry` to be of type `clap_plugin_entry_t`, which initializes `clap_version` to `1.0.0`, despite the value missing in my value.

Where it does crash now, which does not come as a surprise to me, is

```cpp
entry->init(clap.c_str());
```

of which the lack of surprise comes from the fact that `entry` definitiely does _not_ have `init` implemented.

If I compose a new `clap_entry` that implements the absolute bare minimum that conforms to the `clap_plugin_entry_t` type, I end up with

```c
#include "../libs/clap/include/clap/clap.h"

static bool entry_init(const char *plugin_path) { return true; }

static void entry_deinit(void) {}

static const void *entry_get_factory(const char *factory_id) { return NULL; }

CLAP_EXPORT const clap_plugin_entry_t clap_entry = {
    .clap_version = CLAP_VERSION_INIT,
    .init = entry_init,
    .deinit = entry_deinit,
    .get_factory = entry_get_factory};
```

Now, `entry->init(clap.c_str());` succeeds (according to my expert debug logging statements). Onwards!

### Step 4: Perseverance in debugging

Where it crashes now, perhaps not that surprisingly, is the second line of

```cpp
auto fac = (clap_plugin_factory_t *)entry->get_factory(CLAP_PLUGIN_FACTORY_ID);
auto plugin_count = fac->get_plugin_count(fac);
```

My `entry_get_factory()` implementation returns `NULL`, so running `fac->get_plugin_count(fac)` logically crashes. Let me fix that.

```c
// ...

// New
static uint32_t plugin_factory_get_plugin_count(const clap_plugin_factory_t *factory) {
  return 1; // untrue, but required to keep clap-info from crashing
}

// New
static const clap_plugin_factory_t factory = {
    .get_plugin_count = plugin_factory_get_plugin_count,
};


// static const void *entry_get_factory(const char *factory_id) { return NULL; }
// replaced by
static const void *entry_get_factory(const char *factory_id) {
  return &factory;
}

// ...
```

Now, it crashes when trying to run

```cpp
auto desc = fac->get_plugin_descriptor(fac, plug);
```

which again makes sense, because I haven't defined `get_plugin_descriptor`, which is a property of `clap_plugin_factory_t`. Let me go ahead and implement it.

```c
// ...

// New
// the only properties that clap-info reads
static const clap_plugin_descriptor_t desc = {
    .id = "me.tphbrok.plugin",
    .name = "Plugin",
    .features = (const char *[]){"effect", NULL},
};

// New
static const clap_plugin_descriptor_t *
get_plugin_descriptor(const struct clap_plugin_factory *factory,
                      uint32_t index) {
  return &desc;
}

static const clap_plugin_factory_t factory = {
    .get_plugin_count = plugin_factory_get_plugin_count,
    .get_plugin_descriptor = get_plugin_descriptor, // Added
};

// ...
```

### Step 5: Almost there!

This endless session of debugging and creating a minimum CLAP plug-in implementation from scratch is slowly coming to an actual end. Running `clap-info` now when trying to call the following function that is still missing from my implementation:

```cpp
auto inst = fac->create_plugin(fac, host, desc->id);
```

I'll add a basic implementation of `create_plugin`, where a quick inspection of what `clap-info` wants to do with the created plug-in reveals that I'll need to implement properties `init`, `activate`, `deactivate` and `destroy` of type `clap_plugin_t` (which `create_plugin` returns).

```c
// ...

static bool plugin_init(const struct clap_plugin *plugin) { return true; }

static void plugin_destroy(const struct clap_plugin *plugin) {}

static bool plugin_activate(const struct clap_plugin *plugin,
                            double sample_rate, uint32_t min_frames_count,
                            uint32_t max_frames_count) {
  return true;
}

static void plugin_deactivate(const struct clap_plugin *plugin) {}

clap_plugin_t plugin = {
    .desc = &desc,
    .init = plugin_init,
    .destroy = plugin_destroy,
    .activate = plugin_activate,
    .deactivate = plugin_deactivate,
};

static const clap_plugin_t *
create_plugin(const struct clap_plugin_factory *factory,
              const clap_host_t *host, const char *plugin_id) {
  return &plugin;
}

static const clap_plugin_factory_t factory = {
    .get_plugin_count = plugin_factory_get_plugin_count,
    .get_plugin_descriptor = get_plugin_descriptor,
    .create_plugin = create_plugin, // Added
};

// ...
```

Now, `clap-info` crashes when trying to check a bunch of plug-in metadata properties which I don't need at this moment, such as `annExt`, `audioPorts`, `notePorts`, `paramShow` and `otherExt`, which I can skip by adding `--brief` when running `clap-info`.

Guess what `clap-info` now outputs?

```json
{
    "clap-version": "1.2.5",
    "file": "./plugin.clap",
    "plugin_count": 1,
    "plugins": [
        {
            "descriptor": {
                "id": "me.tphbrok.plugin",
                "name": "Plugin"
            },
            "extensions": null,
            "plugin-index": 0
        }
    ]
}
```

I think this milestone is big enough to call an end to this post.
