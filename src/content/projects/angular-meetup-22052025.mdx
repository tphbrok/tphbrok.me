Whether you attended the talk or not, thanks for being here!

Inspired by "The Phoenix Project" and "The Unicorn Project," my talk "The Mocking Project" used a narrative to explore common challenges faced by frontend developers dealing with unreliable backend environments, slow API changes, and poor documentation.

I demonstrated how using msw (Mock Service Worker) and Faker.js can enable a robust, independent Local Development&trade; environment. This approach allows teams to decouple frontend development from backend dependencies, improve testing, and significantly boost productivity.
